# Databases

## Original Artifact
**Course**: CS-340 – Advanced Programming Concepts  
**Artifact**: MongoDB-based application (companies.json import, queries, aggregation pipelines, dashboard code)

**Description**: Involved data import, basic CRUD operations, verification queries, and aggregation pipelines for analytics.

## Enhancement Description
The enhancement adds advanced analytics and security features:

### Key Enhancements
- Complex **aggregation pipelines** for grouping, sorting, averages, and statistics (e.g., by industry, size, location)
- Interactive filters and visualizations (if using Python/Dash, or client-side JS charts)
- Basic security simulation (role-based access checks, input sanitization)
- Performance optimization for large result sets

These improvements move the artifact from basic querying to production-like analytical capabilities with security considerations.

### Alignment with Course Outcomes
- **Outcome 2**: Professional visual communications through data visualizations  
- **Outcome 4**: Innovative use of MongoDB tools to deliver value (advanced analytics)  
- **Outcome 5**: Security mindset — anticipating exploits and implementing mitigation
