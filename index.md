# Welcome to My CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Hello! I'm Amaro Terrazas, a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University.  
This ePortfolio presents my selected and enhanced artifacts from previous coursework, demonstrating growth across three key areas of computer science:

- **Software Design & Engineering**  
  Transformation of Agile documentation into a functional interactive Kanban board prototype (from CS-250)

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
  Optimization of Binary Search Tree with balancing and hybrid improvements (from CS-300)

- **Databases**  
  Advanced aggregation analytics and security enhancements in MongoDB dashboard (from CS-340)
