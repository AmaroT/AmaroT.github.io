# CS300: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository showcases the projects and assignments completed as part of the **CS300: Data Structures and Algorithms** course. It highlights my ability to implement and analyze various data structures, including **Binary Search Tree**, **Hash Table**, **Linked List**, and **Vector Sorting**, while also adhering to software development best practices. Together, these artifacts reflect my problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and deepened understanding of algorithmic complexity.

## Overview

The primary focus of this course was on learning and implementing essential data structures and algorithms to solve programming problems effectively. Each project allowed me to apply concepts such as sorting, searching, and analyzing runtime efficiency. By working on tasks like course management systems, bid sorting tools, and hash table operations, I developed skills in designing efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Projects

### Advising Assistance Project
The Advising Assistance Project focuses on managing a set of Computer Science courses using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. The application allows users to load course data, display courses in alphanumeric order, and search for specific course information.

- **Key Features**:
    - Read course data from a file.
    - Store and organize data using a BST.
    - Display courses sorted alphanumerically.
    - Search for and display course details, including prerequisites.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  This project emphasized the importance of using the right data structure (BST) to efficiently sort and search large datasets. Recursive methods were implemented for insertion, traversal, and search operations.

### Binary Search Tree Project
The Binary Search Tree Project demonstrates my ability to use a **BST** to manage and organize bid data for a property auction system. This project focuses on dynamic memory management, algorithm optimization, and recursive tree operations.

- **Key Features**:
    - Perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals.
    - Efficiently insert, search, and remove bids from the tree.
    - Load bid data dynamically from a file.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  Working with BSTs improved my understanding of recursion, algorithm complexity, and modular code design. The project highlighted the benefits of **O(log n)** operations for balanced trees.

### Hash Table Project
The Hash Table Project focused on implementing a hash table to efficiently manage and retrieve course data using hashing and collision handling.

- **Key Features**:
    - Store course data using a hash table with chaining for collision handling.
    - Provide fast lookup for course details.
    - Insert and retrieve data with optimal efficiency.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  This project reinforced the importance of **O(1)** lookup time for hash tables and highlighted challenges in collision handling. I learned how to implement linked lists at hash table indices to resolve collisions effectively.

### Linked List Project
The Linked List Project utilizes a **singly linked list** to manage bid data for municipal auctions. This project demonstrates dynamic memory management and menu-driven program design.

- **Key Features**:
    - Append, prepend, search, and remove bids dynamically.
    - Load bid data from a CSV file.
    - Provide a user-friendly menu for data operations.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  Working with linked lists deepened my understanding of pointer manipulation and dynamic memory allocation. I learned how linked lists provide flexibility for data insertion and removal.

### Vector Sorting Project
The Vector Sorting Project involved managing and sorting bid data using a **vector** data structure. It highlights my ability to work with dynamic arrays and implement sorting algorithms.

- **Key Features**:
    - Load bid data into a vector dynamically.
    - Implement sorting algorithms to organize bids efficiently.
    - Provide a user interface for sorting and searching operations.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  This project emphasized the importance of algorithm efficiency when working with dynamic arrays. I explored sorting techniques and analyzed their impact on runtime performance.

## Reflections

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem I addressed in these projects was efficiently storing, sorting, and searching large datasets. Whether it was course information, bid data, or user inputs, each project required selecting the appropriate data structure to solve the problem optimally.

### How did you approach the problem?
Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures was critical. For example:
- **Binary Search Trees** were ideal for maintaining sorted order and enabling fast search operations.
- **Hash Tables** provided constant time lookup for unordered data.
- **Linked Lists** offered flexibility for dynamic memory allocation.
  By analyzing each problem's requirements, I applied the most efficient structure.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?
I encountered challenges such as debugging recursive functions, resolving collisions in hash tables, and managing environment setup on my Mac. I overcame these by carefully analyzing the logic, implementing detailed debugging statements, and configuring the development tools correctly.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software?
These projects taught me to design software systematically. I learned to:
- Plan the solution using pseudocode and flowcharts.
- Break down problems into smaller, modular components.
- Write clean, maintainable code with clear comments and reusable functions.

### How has your work evolved the way you write programs?
I now prioritize:
- **Readability**: Writing clear and modular code.
- **Maintainability**: Structuring programs for easy updates.
- **Efficiency**: Selecting optimal data structures and algorithms to solve problems.
