# CS 250 - Sprint Review and Retrospective

## Overview
This repository contains my **Sprint Review and Retrospective** document for CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle. This artifact demonstrates my understanding and application of **Agile and Scrum** principles throughout the course.

Additionally, this repository includes two other projects: **Top Five Travel Destinations** and **Top Five Destinations for Well-Being**, both of which further showcase my ability to apply Agile methodologies, analyze data, and create structured presentations.

As part of my **Computer Science Portfolio**, this submission highlights my ability to work within **Agile methodologies**, effectively collaborate with a team, and develop software iteratively while responding to user needs.

## Essential Questions and Reflections

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs is critical in software development. By using **user stories**, I was able to break down **functional requirements** into clear, manageable tasks that provide direct **value to the customer**. User stories help define features from the end-user’s perspective and ensure that development aligns with **business goals and user expectations**. Through backlog refinement and sprint planning, I prioritized high-value features to improve efficiency and product quality.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach software development using an **iterative, incremental mindset**. Agile development processes, such as **Scrum**, emphasize **continuous feedback, adaptability, and collaboration**. Some Agile practices I plan to use in future development include:
- **Sprint Planning** for defining clear objectives and priorities.
- **Daily Stand-ups** to synchronize progress and remove blockers.
- **Continuous Integration and Testing** to ensure high code quality.
- **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives** to improve processes based on feedback.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development **communicates effectively**, **collaborates**, and **adapts to change**. In an Agile environment, this means:
- Contributing to a **self-organizing, cross-functional team**.
- Actively participating in **Scrum events** (stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives).
- Providing **constructive feedback** and embracing **continuous improvement**.
- Being accountable for **delivering high-quality work** while supporting teammates.
