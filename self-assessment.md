# Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program at SNHU, I have developed a comprehensive skill set that aligns with all five program outcomes. The enhancements in this ePortfolio provide concrete evidence of this growth.

### Outcome 1 – Collaborative Environments
The interactive Kanban prototype supports team collaboration and decision-making through visual task tracking — directly reflecting Agile principles learned in CS-250.

### Outcome 2 – Professional Communications
All narratives are written objectively, enhancements include clear visualizations, and the code review video will demonstrate coherent technical explanation.

### Outcome 3 – Design & Evaluation of Solutions
The BST balancing and hybrid structure choices show explicit management of algorithmic trade-offs. Prototype scope decisions balanced functionality with simplicity.

### Outcome 4 – Innovative Techniques & Tools
Use of modern JavaScript for interactivity, AVL balancing, advanced MongoDB aggregations, and benchmarking demonstrate innovative application of tools for industry-relevant goals.

### Outcome 5 – Security Mindset
Input validation, sanitization, and role-based access considerations across enhancements reflect proactive vulnerability mitigation.

These enhancements collectively illustrate my readiness for professional software development roles, with a strong foundation in agile practices, efficient algorithms, and secure data management.

Thank you for reviewing my CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio.
